To date 67 have been numbered and placed into the world’s official minor bodies catalog maintained by the International Astronomical Union (IAU, Paris).  Numbered asteroids can be named by their discoverers."]},{question:"What happens if I discover an asteroid?",answer:["New object is measured and confirmed by IASC as a preliminary detection. Preliminary detections are followed by the observations made by big sky surveys such as Pan-STAARS and Catalina. If a follow-up confirms your discovery it will receive provisional status by the Minor Planet Center.  Provisional objects are measured again and again by sky surveys / amateurs until the orbit is defined.After 3-10 years of observations the asteroid is numbered and placed into the world’s official minor planets catalog by the International Astronomical Union. The discoverers will get the chance to name the numbered asteroid.
